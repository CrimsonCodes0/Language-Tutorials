# Conditional Statements

## Start

## Conditional operators

In python, we have several logical conditions which come from mathematics.

1. Equal: `a == b`
2. Not equal: `a != b`
3. Less than: `a < b`
4. Greater than: `a > b`
5. Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
6. Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`

## If-Elif-Else

The first statement we will learn about is the if statement. The if statement takes in a **condition** and runs code inside of it *only* if the condition turns out to be `True`.

The else state

Example:
## Code
```python
person1_age = 10
person2_age = 5

if person1_age > person2_age:
    print("Person 2 is younger than person 1")
```


## Output
```shell
Person 2 is younger than person 1
```


The above example compares the ages of two variables called `person1_age` and `person2_age`, and uses an `if` statement to check whether **person1** is older than **person2**. This turns out to be true, so we print so.
